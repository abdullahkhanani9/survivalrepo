The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. Here's a summary of what happened:

- Construction and Maiden Voyage: The RMS Titanic, a British luxury passenger liner, was constructed in the early 20th century by the White Star Line. It was hailed as one of the most luxurious and technologically advanced ships of its time. On April 10, 1912, the Titanic embarked on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, bound for New York City, USA.

- Collision with an Iceberg: On the night of April 14, 1912, while sailing through the North Atlantic Ocean, the Titanic struck an iceberg. The collision caused extensive damage to the ship's hull, puncturing several compartments and leading to flooding below decks.

- Sinking: Despite efforts to contain the flooding and evacuate passengers, the Titanic began to sink rapidly. The ship lacked an adequate number of lifeboats for all passengers and crew on board. As a result, many passengers were left stranded on the sinking ship or were forced to take their chances in the frigid waters.

- Rescue Efforts: Distress signals were sent out, and nearby ships, including the RMS Carpathia, responded to the Titanic's calls for help. The Carpathia arrived at the scene hours after the Titanic had sunk and rescued over 700 survivors from lifeboats and life rafts.

- Casualties: Tragically, more than 1,500 people lost their lives in the sinking of the Titanic, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. The victims included passengers and crew from various social and economic backgrounds.

- Investigation and Legacy: The sinking of the Titanic prompted significant changes in maritime safety regulations, including the requirement for ships to carry enough lifeboats for all passengers and crew, improved communication systems, and better ice patrol measures in iceberg-prone areas. The disaster also led to inquiries and investigations into the causes of the sinking, highlighting issues such as inadequate safety measures, overconfidence in the ship's design, and human error.

- Overall, the sinking of the Titanic remains a poignant reminder of the fragility of human life and the importance of prioritizing safety at sea.
